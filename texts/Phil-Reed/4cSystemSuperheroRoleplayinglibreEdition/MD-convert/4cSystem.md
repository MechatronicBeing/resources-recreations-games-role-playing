# 4C System

4C is a RPG toolkit rather than complete game system; it provides a foundation for you to build upon. As presented, 4C is specifically for superhero roleplaying though it could be adapted to other genres with a bit more work.

## For Gamers

As a gamer you can use 4C to "build" your own game system or to assist in converting 4C products to similar systems. 4C is not a replacement for any games that you may already own but is, rather, an aid.

## For Publishers

You can use 4C as the basis for an entirely new game – strip out the powers and drop in appropriate origins and "classes,"\* for example, to create a fantasy game – or as common ground for the development of material that is compatible with other games that use a similar system.

4C is released to the public as public domain and almost every part of the text, including the title, is open for use (the names of those involved in the creation of 4C are not open for use). The copyright on 4C is unassigned and the text is donated to the public domain; anyone can use this material for their own products and with their own ideas.

\* A class could be nothing more than a set package of abilities; by selecting a "class" the character gains specific skills and abilities.

## Dice

4C uses "percentile dice", two differently colored ten-sided dice with one die designated the "tens" die and the other the "ones" die. Whenever the rules state roll d% roll both dice to generate a number between 0 (both dice show "0") and 99 (both dice show "9").

Remember that unlike many other systems, a result of 00 in 4C is 0 rather than 100.

*Example: Richard rolls d%. The "tens" die comes up 8 and the "ones" die comes up 3, for a roll of 83.*

## Advanced

Throughout this text are boxes marked as "Advanced." These boxes present new rules and ideas that build on the basic text. Publishers and players can mix and match these rules to create a system for their exact needs. Publishers, for ease of reference, are encouraged to stick to either the Basic or Advanced version when creating a compatible product and cite which version is used for their product. If you're creating an entirely new game based on this system compatibility is not a concern and you're free to do anything you wish.

# Characters

## Character Origin

The first step in character creation is to determine the character's origin. Roll d% on the following table:

|          |                          |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| **Roll** | **Origin**               |
| 00-04    | Robot                    |
| 05-09    | Alien                    |
| 10-39    | Skilled Human            |
| 40-59    | Changed Human            |
| 60-79    | Mutant                   |
| 80-99    | Technologically Enhanced |

|                              |                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Robot**                    | The character is a robot or perhaps some other construct, such as a golem.                                   |
| **Alien**                    | The character is a being from another world or dimension such as a Martian, elemental, angel, or devil.      |
| **Skilled Human**            | The character is a highly skilled human; any "powers" are actually superior training or specialized devices. |
| **Changed Human**            | The character was human but became superhuman through some outside agency, often an accident or experiment.  |
| **Mutant**                   | The character was born with or destined to develop superhuman powers.                                        |
| **Technologically Enhanced** | The character's powers are the result of devices and gadgets.                                                |

## Advanced Character Origins

As per standard character creation, roll randomly for traits, powers, and skills and then modify the results for the origin of the character:

|                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Origin**                   | **Modifiers**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Robot**                    | The Rank Values of all Primary Traits are each increased by +10. The character's Repute is reduced to 0.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Alien**                    | The Rank Values of all Primary Traits are each increased by +10. The character loses one powerbut still retains a minimum of one power.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Skilled Human**            | The character gains three bonus skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Changed Human**            | One of the character's Primary Traits (select one) is increased by +10.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Mutant**                   | The character's Fortitude is increased by +10. The character's Lifestyle is reduced by -10 (minimum of 1). The character gains one bonus power and all of the character's powers should be innate and not derived from equipment. The character's Repute is reduced to 0. |
| **Technologically Enhanced** | The character's Intellect is increased by +20. The character's Lifestyle is increased by +20.                                                                                                                                                                             |

# Traits

4C characters are defined by a set of distinct Traits. Each character has two types of Traits: Primary and Secondary. Primary Traits are defined by Rank Values, Secondary Traits are defined by either Rank Value or a numerical score (see individual Secondary Traits for details).

## Primary Traits

4C features a total of seven Primary Traits:

### Melee

This Primary Trait is the measure of a character's expertise in melee combat. When kicking, punching, stabbing, or otherwise fighting in close quarters, this Trait determines the success or failure of the attack.

### Coordination

This Primary Trait is the measure of a character's physical proficiency. When shooting, throwing, dodging, balancing, or otherwise employing physical nimbleness, this Trait determines the success or failure of the action.

### Brawn

This Primary Trait is the measure of a character's physical power. When lifting heavy objects, determining damage with melee or thrown attacks, throwing an object a certain distance, or otherwise engaged in activities relying on physical power, this Trait determines the success or failure of the action.

### Fortitude

This Primary Trait is the measure of a character's physical stamina and robustness. When attempting to hold breath, resist sickness, overcome toxins, ignore fatigue, keep from dying, or otherwise engaged in physically strenuous tasks, this Trait determines the success or failure of the action.

### Intellect

This Primary Trait is a measure of the character's intelligence. When attempting to invent, solve a problem, learn, or otherwise use smarts, this Trait determines the success or failure of the action.

### Awareness

This Primary Trait is a measure of the character's intuition. When attempting to sense danger, spot something, recognize a hunch, or otherwise work on instinct rather than analyzing a situation, this Trait determines the success or failure of the action.

### Willpower

This Primary Trait is a measure of the character's mental strength. When dealing with psychic abilities, magic powers, issues of willpower, or otherwise using powers of the mind, this Trait determines the success or failure of the action.

### Determining Primary Trait Rank Values

Roll d% once on the following table for each Primary Trait to determine its Rank Value:

|               |                |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| **Dice Roll** | **Rank Value** |
| 00-04         | 1              |
| 05-09         | 3              |
| 10-19         | 6              |
| 20-39         | 10             |
| 40-59         | 20             |
| 60-79         | 30             |
| 80-95         | 40             |
| 96-99         | 50             |

## Secondary Traits

4C characters have four Secondary Traits:

### Damage

This Secondary Trait is a measure of the physical punishment a character can suffer before dying. This Secondary Trait uses a numerical score (not Rank Value) that is decreased as the character takes damage. This Secondary Trait, as well as damage and healing, is discussed further under ‘Character Health, Hit Points, or Vitality'.

This Secondary Trait's starting value is calculated by adding up the Rank Values of the character's first four Primary Traits (Melee, Coordination, Brawn, and Fortitude).

### Fortune

This Secondary Trait is a measure of the character's ability to use luck, training, and/or experience to influence the present (discussed further under ‘Nine Lives'). This Secondary Trait uses a numerical score (not Rank Value) and points may be spent from it to affect die rolls and improve the Rank Values of Primary Traits (discussed further under ‘Fluctuating Fortunes').

This Secondary Trait's starting value is calculated by adding together the Rank Values of the character's last three Primary Traits (Intellect, Awareness, and Willpower).

### Lifestyle

This Trait is a measure of the character's wealth and ability to procure needed items and services (discussed further under ‘Character Assets, Means, or Resources').

*To calculate the Rank Value for this Secondary Trait roll once on Table 1.*

### Repute

This Secondary Trait is a measure of how well the character is known; the greater the score the more popular the character. This Secondary Trait uses a numerical score (not Rank Value); how this Trait influences the game is covered under ‘Character Fame, Popularity, or Prestige'.

*To calculate this Secondary Trait's value roll d% and divide the result by 3 (round up).*

# Rank Values

Rank Values are the numerical representation of Traits and power levels in 4C. Rank Values range from 0 to 1000. Most characters will have Rank Values in the 1-50 range with exceptionally powerful characters having Rank Values of 51 or greater. Although no character may have a Rank Value of 0, characters may be 0reduced to the rank of 0 in special situations. Here is a comparison of the different Rank Values:

|                      |                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Rank Value Range** | **Description**      |
| 01-02                | Minimum human        |
| 03-05                | Below-average human  |
| 06-09                | Average human        |
| 10-19                | Above-average human  |
| 20-29                | Exceptional human    |
| 30-39                | Maximum human limit  |
| 40-49                | Low superhuman       |
| 50-74                | Superhuman           |
| 75-99                | High superhuman      |
| 100-149              | Low cosmic           |
| 150-999              | Cosmic               |
| 1000                 | Beyond comprehension |

## Advanced Rank Values

The Advanced game takes the highest Rank Value groups and divides them so that instead of 12 groups (13 if you count 0) there are now 17 (18 with 0). This is primarily for the introduction of extremely powerful (cosmic) beings. If you're running a fairly low-level game you may want to stick with the smaller selection.

## Optional Rule: Rank Names

Although not necessary, Gamemasters may wish to assign names to the various Rank Value ranges as a means of adding additional flavor. The following is a list of suggested Rank Names.

|                      |                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Rank Value Range** | **Rank Name**                                  |
| 01-02                | Doddering, Feeble, Weak                        |
| 03-05                | Inferior, Poor, Shabby                         |
| 06-09                | Average, Mundane, Typical                      |
| 10-19                | Accomplished, Competent, Good                  |
| 20-29                | Excellent, Exceptional, Skillful               |
| 30-39                | Extraordinary, Remarkable, Super               |
| 40-49                | Fantastic, Incredible, Wonderful               |
| 50-74                | Amazing, Astounding, Legendary                 |
| 75-99                | Colossal, Monstrous, Monumental                |
| 100-149              | Astonishing, Marvelous, Unearthly              |
| 150-999              | Inconceivable, Indescribable, Unthinkable\*    |
| 1000                 | Incomprehensible, Improbable, Unimaginable\*\* |

\* Rank Values of this magnitude can also be described using abstract terms such as Move A, Shift 1, or Step X.

\*\* Rank Values at this level may best be described in abstract terms such as Class A, Magnitude 1000, or Mark Z.

# Skills

After Origins and Traits characters may possess skills, mundane talents that grant them a benefit when performing a specific action or operating in a pre-determined field of expertise.

## Skill Determination

To determine the number of skills a character possesses roll d% on the following table:

|          |                      |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| **Roll** | **Number of Skills** |
| 00-19    | 1                    |
| 20-59    | 2                    |
| 60-89    | 3                    |
| 90-99    | 4                    |

###### Using Skills

Such things as Acrobatics, Investigation, Pilot, Drive, and Martial Arts are considered skills; discuss the skills you would like a character to have with the Gamemaster for approval. A skill grants a +1 Row Step bonus when making any rolls on the Master Table during an action appropriate to the skill in question.

######   
Advanced Option: Contacts

In place of a skill a character may possess a contact. A contact is a friend or acquaintance the character can call on for assistance. Contacts must be cleared with the Gamemaster though any reasonable contact idea should be automatically allowed. (Attempting to claim the President of the U.S. as a contact is going to be a lot more difficult to have approved by the Gamemaster than a low-level police officer.)

## Advanced Skills

With Gamemaster approval a character may take one advanced skill in place of two skills. An advanced skill grants a +2 Row Step bonus.

# Powers

Powers are what make the character a superhero.

## Power Determination

To determine the number of powers a character possesses roll d% on the following table:

|          |                      |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| **Roll** | **Number of Powers** |
| 00-19    | 2                    |
| 20-59    | 3                    |
| 60-89    | 4                    |
| 90-98    | 5                    |
| 99       | Magic\*              |

\* Magic is a unique power able to replicate all other powers.

Once you've determined the number of powers for a character roll d% once for each power on the Basic Power Selection or Advanced Power Selection table to determine the character's specific powers:

######

If you roll the same power twice you may elect to either increase the power's Rank Value by +20 or roll again on the table.

## Advanced Power Selection

If playing under the Advanced options, characters have a larger number of powers available. Roll d% once for each power on the following table to determine the character's specific powers:

### Determining Power Rank Values

Roll d% once on the following table for each Power to determine its Rank Value:

|               |                |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| **Dice Roll** | **Rank Value** |
| 00-04         | 1              |
| 05-09         | 3              |
| 10-19         | 6              |
| 20-39         | 10             |
| 40-59         | 20             |
| 60-79         | 30             |
| 80-95         | 40             |
| 96-99         | 50             |

## Power Descriptions

The following are the descriptions of the various powers. Each description includes general ways in which the power can be used during a game session. The Gamemaster sets the difficulty for specific actions attempted by characters with their powers.

### Absorption

The character is immune to damage inflicted by a specific elemental or energy type (select one, see ‘Elemental/Energy Control') up to the Rank Value of this power. Any damage inflicted over the Rank Value of this power is suffered normally.

The character may use the absorbed energy in one of two ways:

1.  Healing. The character instantly recovers a number of damage points equal to the damage absorbed, up to his maximum value.

2.  Attack. The character, on his next turn, may unleash the absorbed energy as an attack. Treat as an appropriate elemental or energy control attack with a Rank Value equal to the number of damage points absorbed.

### Alter-Ego

The character possesses another form, a different persona he can willingly change into. Create a second character to use as this character's Alter-Ego. The second character automatically has no powers and is a skilled human (do not roll for powers or origin). Additionally, the second character cannot possess any primary trait with a Rank Value greater than 30; any result rolled over 30 is automatically reduced to 30.

### Amplified Elemental/Energy Control

The Rank Value of the character's Elemental/Energy Control power (select one element or energy type) is increased by one-half the Rank Value of this power. In addition to the power boost, when using his Elemental/Energy Control power the character rolls three dice, designating two of the dice as the tens die and then discarding one of the two after the roll.

A character that possesses Elemental/Energy Generation – but not Elemental/Energy Control – can also control the chosen element or energy as per the Elemental/Energy Control power, but that control is at an effective Rank Value equal to one-half the Rank Value of this power +10.

### Animal Command

The character can communicate with and control animals. To successfully communicate with an animal the character must roll d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of this power or the character's Willpower +10, whichever is greater. A result of red or greater indicates successful communication. To control an animal, the character must achieve a yellow result.

The character can control one type of animal (such as birds, reptiles, mammals, sea creatures, etc.), which must be determined at the time of the character's creation.

### Astoundingly Wealthy

Not a "power," this result increases the character's Lifestyle by +50 and Repute by +20.

### Body Armor

The character has armor of some kind, perhaps thick hide or a protective bodysuit, which reduces damage by an amount equal to the Rank Value of this power.

### Burrowing

The character possesses the ability to tunnel beneath the earth, moving at a rate equal to his normal running speed (see ‘Movement') through any subterranean terrain with a material rank equal to or less than the Rank Value of this power. The character cannot burrow through other characters.

### Celebrity

Not a "power," this result increases the character's Repute by +30. The character is so famous that whenever he would gain or lose Repute the values are doubled. The character cannot possess a secret identity.

### Chameleon

The character's body, as well as worn or carried items, can be changed at will allowing the character to blend into the surroundings. This is similar to Invisibility, except it is easier to detect the character; anyone searching for the character rolls d% and adds the Rank Value of their Awareness trait to the roll and compares it against the character's d% roll plus the Rank Value of this power. If the character rolls higher than the searcher the character remains hidden.

### Claws

The character has some form of claws, either a natural part of the character's body or a worn item. The character uses the Rank Value of either the character's Melee or this power to make slashing attacks. Claws are treated as a one-handed weapon for purposes of damage.

**Optional:** Instead of claws the character possesses another type of weapon of the player's choosing which may be used for bashing or slashing attacks (choose one).

### Combat Awareness

The character has a special sense that alerts the character to danger seconds before it strikes. In all instances in which the Awareness trait is used the character uses the Rank Value of this power or the character's Awareness +10, whichever is greater.

### Contaminant Resistance

The character possesses a strong resistance to toxins, diseases, and the like. Any time the character must roll to resist the effects of poison, disease, or similar environmental hazards the character may use the Rank Value of this power or the Rank Value of Fortitude +10, whichever is greater.

### Detection

The character has the ability to detect a specific form of energy, power, or supernatural presence.

Players that wish to possess a form of detection not listed here are encouraged to discuss the idea with their Gamemaster. Otherwise, select one type from the following list:

**Magic:** The character can detect magical energy – spells, artifacts, those with the ability to use magic, etc. – within a number of sectors equal to the Rank Value of this power.

**Magnetic:** The character can detect magnetic fields – usually powers of those possessing magnetic control – within a number of sectors equal to the Rank Value of this power.

**Psionic:** The character can detect psionic activity or ability –when a power is used or someone possesses a power – within a number of sectors equal to the Rank Value of this power.

**Radioactive:** The character can detect radioactive energy within a number of sectors equal to the Rank Value of this power.

**Spirit:** The character can detect spiritual activity – such as ghosts – within a number of sectors equal to the Rank Value of this power.

### Dimension Jump

The character can move at will between dimensions. The character may freely jump to another dimension he has previously visited but visiting a new dimension requires the character to roll d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of this power. A result of black means that the character arrives dazed at the destination dimension and must spend the next turn recovering (the character may take no actions that turn).

### Elasticity

The character's body can stretch, allowing the character to attack someone in a different sector. A character with this power can stretch a number of sectors equal to this power's Rank Value divided by 10 (round up).

### Elemental/Energy Control

The character has the ability to control the weather or a single element or type of energy. The character can only manipulate an existing source of the element or energy; the character does not possess the ability to spontaneously create the element or energy.

Note that the below are guidelines only. The exact extent of what these powers can do is up to the Gamemaster.

**Attacking:** A character using Elemental/Energy Control to attack may use either the power's Rank Value or the character's Melee Rank Value +10, whichever is greater, for melee attacks. For ranged attacks use the power's Rank Value or the character's Coordination Rank Value +10. Damage inflicted in either case is equal to the power's Rank Value.

**Force Field/Armor:** See the respective powers.

**Lifting Objects:** The upper weight limit of an object the character may lift is based on the power's Rank Value:

|                |            |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Weight** |
| 01-02          | 50 lb.     |
| 03-05          | 100 lbs.   |
| 06-09          | 200 lbs.   |
| 10-19          | 400 lbs.   |
| 20-29          | 800 lbs.   |
| 30-39          | 1 ton      |
| 40-49          | 10 tons    |
| 50-74          | 50 tons    |
| 75-99          | 80 tons    |
| 100-149        | 100 tons   |
| 150-999        | 200 tons   |
| 1000           | 400 tons   |

**Weather Control:** A subset of elemental/energy control, a character may choose to manipulate the weather. This power can be especially powerful since it allows a character to manipulate air, lightning, rain, and any other aspect associated with storms/weather so the Gamemaster may choose to have Weather Control count as two of a character's powers.

**Elemental Control**

*Air:* The character can manipulate winds to attack, create force fields, lift objects, etc.

*Earth:* The character can manipulate the ground to attack, create walls of earth that act as armor, lift objects, etc.

*Fire:* The character can manipulate fire to attack, increase or decrease the temperate of a flame, create a wall of fire like a force field, etc.

*Water:* The character can manipulate water to attack, create walls of water that act as armor, lift objects, etc.

**Energy Control**

*Electrical:* The character can manipulate electricity to attack, create force fields, lift objects, etc.

*Light:* The character can manipulate light to attack, blind opponents, create force fields, etc.

*Magnetic:* The character can manipulate ferrous metals to attack, create walls of metal that act as armor, lift metallic objects, etc.

*Sound:* The character can manipulate sound to attack, lift objects, create force fields, etc.

### Elemental/Energy Generation

The character has the ability to spontaneously generate a single element or type of energy chosen from the the Elemental/Energy Control power list. The character can also control the chosen element or energy as per the Elemental/Energy Control power but that control is at an effective Rank Value equal to one-half the Rank Value of this power.

A character that possesses matching Elemental/Energy Control and Elemental/Energy Generation gains a permanent +10 Rank Value bonus to both powers.

### Extra Body Parts

The character additional body parts beyond two arms and two legs, either a completely new part (such as a tail) or extras of an existing part (four arms instead of two). Extra parts do not grant a character bonus attacks.

**Advanced Extra Body Parts**

In the Advanced game, the character selects a single extra body part. Extra body parts function as follows:

**Claws:** The character gains the Claws power. If the character already possesses the Claws power the power's Rank Value is increased by +20.

**Extra Arms:** The character gains one bonus attack each turn.

**Extra Legs:** The character moves faster; increase movement by 1 sector each turn.

**Shell:** The character gains the Body Armor power. If the character already possesses the Body Armor power the power's Rank Value is increased by +20.

**Tail:** The character gains one bonus attack each turn and may use the tail as if it were an extra arm.

**Wings:** The character gains the Flight power with the speed determined by the Rank Value of this power. If the character already possesses the Flight power the power's Rank Value is increased by +20.

### Fast Attack

A character with this power can attack a number of times each turn based on the power's Rank Value:

|                |                  |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Attacks/Turn** |
| 01-29          | 2                |
| 30-49          | 3                |
| 50             | 4                |

### Flight

The character can fly either through the use of an item or by innate means. When flying the character can move a number of sectors per turn depending on the Rank Value of the power:

|                |                  |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Sectors/Turn** |
| 01-02          | 1                |
| 03-05          | 2                |
| 06-09          | 3                |
| 10-19          | 4                |
| 20-29          | 5                |
| 30-39          | 6                |
| 40-49          | 7                |
| 50-74          | 8                |
| 75-99          | 9                |
| 100-149        | 10               |
| 150-999        | 15               |
| 1000           | \*               |

\* The character can circle the world in a single turn.

### Force Field

The character has the ability to generate a force field, either through mental powers or a device.

**Device:** The force field acts as armor with a Rank Value equal to the power's Rank Value. If an attack deals damage in excess of this force field's Rank Value the device is shorted out for 1-10 turns (during which time it cannot be used).

**Mental:** The force field acts as armor with a Rank Value equal to the power's Rank Value or the character's Willpower +10, whichever is greater. If an attack deals damage in excess of the force field's Rank Value or the character's Willpower +10, whichever is greater, the character must roll d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of the character's Fortitude. A result of black leaves the character dazed and the character must spend 1-10 turns recovering (the character may take no actions during that time). On any other result the character is dazed for one turn.

### Growth/Shrinking

The character can grow larger or smaller (select one), to a maximum/minimum height as shown on the table below:

|                |                    |                    |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Rank Value** | **Maximum Height** | **Minimum Height** |
| 01-02          | 9 feet             | 4 feet             |
| 03-05          | 12 feet            | 3 feet             |
| 06-09          | 15 feet            | 2 feet             |
| 10-19          | 18 feet            | 1 foot             |
| 20-29          | 21 feet            | 6 inches           |
| 30-39          | 24 feet            | 3 inches           |
| 40-49          | 27 feet            | 2 inches           |
| 50-74          | 30 feet            | 1 inch             |
| 75-99          | 60 feet            | ½ inch             |
| 100-149        | 120 feet           | ¼ inch             |
| 150-999        | 240 feet           | 1/8 inch           |
| 1000           | 480 feet           | 1/16 inch          |

When using Growth, the Rank Value of the character's Brawn is changed to the Rank Value of this power or the character's Brawn Rank Value +10 whichever is greater. Opponents attacking the bigger character gain a +1 RS bonus on their attacks.

When using Shrinking the Rank Value of the character's Brawn is unaffected. Anyone attacking the character when using this power suffers a -1 RS penalty and the character gains a +2 RS bonus to attacks.

### Headquarters

The character possesses a secret headquarters. The headquarters size and location must be approved by the Gamemaster. The exact makeup of the headquarters – weapons locker, garage, communications center, prison, etc. – must also be approved by the Gamemaster. The Rank Value of the headquarters should be used as a rough guide.

|                |                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Possible Size and Contents**                                                                                                                          |
| 01-05          | A secret room in an apartment. May include a computer and basic lab. Nothing sophisticated.                                                             |
| 06-09          | An apartment. A home gym would be appropriate. Maybe one piece of advanced technology.                                                                  |
| 10-19          | A house. A few dedicated rooms serve as an armory, a brig, or other specialized duty. May include a garage.                                             |
| 20-29          | A mansion. Sprawling, spacious, and loaded with extras.                                                                                                 |
| 30-39          | A compound. Multiple buildings behind a sturdy fence or wall. A character with a headquarters of this size most likely does not have a secret identity. |
| 40-49          | A skyscraper. Some floors may be rented out as offices or apartments but most of the building is dedicated to the character's pursuit against crime.    |
| 50             | An orbital complex, subterranean city, inter-dimensional residence, or other highly unusual and/or massive complex.                                     |

A headquarters can be of a smaller size than suggested. A Rank Value 50 headquarters, for example, could be a single well-outfitted mansion.

### Improved Skills

Not exactly a "power," this result grants the character two bonus skills and increases the Row Step bonus of one skill to +3.

### Invisibility

The character can become invisible and remain so for as long as desired. Sound, scent, heavy rain, and other methods can still give an invisible character away. The character may also attempt to turn objects or other characters invisible by touching them. Roll d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of this power, on a result or red or greater the item or character touched is invisible and remains so as long as the character touches it.

### Magic

The character possesses knowledge of, and ability to use, magic. Magic allows the character to cast "spells" that duplicate any other power in the game; as a result Magic is the sole power the character may have. A character may use only one spell per turn.

Duplicated powers function as described in the individual power sections and at a Rank Value equal to the character's Magic Rank Value.

### Mind Control

The character can take over the minds of others. A target of Mind Control must be within visual range of the character and must possess a Willpower Rank Value less than the Rank Value of this power or the character's Willpower, whichever is greater.

To take control of another the character must roll d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of this power or the character's Willpower +10, whichever is greater. If the result is black the mind control attempt fails. If the result is red or greater the target is controlled until the character releases the targeted character or the target is ordered to do something out of the ordinary (such as injure a companion) at which point the target rolls d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of the target character's Willpower. A result of red or greater is needed to break free of the mind control.

### Mind Shield

A character with the Mind Shield power possesses a special resistance to Mind Control attempts. For purposes of resisting Mind Control the character's Willpower Rank Value is increased by the Rank Value of his Mind Shield power.

Additionally, the character gains a mental Force Field at a Rank Value equal to one-half the Rank Value of this power. A character who possesses Force Field (Mental) who also has this power gains a bonus equal to one-half the Rank Value of this power.

### Nine Lives

The character is exceptionally lucky. At the start of each game session the character gains a pool of Fortune points equal to twice the Rank Value of this power. These points must be used during that game session to affect die rolls and cannot be saved or used for character improvement. Additionally, once each game session the character may roll the dice without declaring the tens die until after the roll.

### Nullification

The character possesses the ability to nullify – completely negate – the powers of others within a number of sectors equal to one-tenth the Rank Value of this power (round up). To use this power the character must roll d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of this power. If the result is black the nullification attempt fails and the character suffers damage equal to one-half (round up) the Rank Value of the power the character attempted to nullify. If the result is red the targeted power works at half its effectiveness (round up). On any other result the power is negated for this turn.

### One-of-a-Kind Weapon

The character owns a unique weapon of the player's choice which deals damage equal to its Rank Value.

**Melee Weapon:** The character makes melee attacks with the weapon using the weapon's Rank Value or the character's Melee +10, whichever is greater.

**Ranged Weapon:** The character uses the weapon's Rank Value or the character's Coordination +10, whichever is greater, when attacking.

**Incorporated Power:** At the player's discretion one of the character's other powers may be incorporated into the weapon increasing the Rank Value of the incorporated power by +10 but losing the use of the incorporated power if the weapon is lost or stolen.

### Paralyzing Touch

The character's touch can render opponents unable to move. To paralyze an opponent the character must first hit with a melee attack which deals no damage. The target must then roll d% on the Master Table using the target's Fortitude Rank Value to resist. If the result is black the target is paralyzed – knocked down and unconscious – for a number of rounds equal to one-tenth the Rank Value of this power (round up).

### Phasing

The character‘s body can change into an insubstantial form allowing the character to "phase" through objects. The power grants the character armor at the Rank Value of this power.

### Physical Metamorphosis

The character's body can change into an unusual material, selected from the list below, at will. When metamorphosed the character possesses the traits of the material and gains armor equal to the Rank Value of this power.

Depending on the form and Gamemaster approval the character may make use of the Rank Value of this power to determine damage when attacking (punching with fists of steel, igniting things if made of fire, etc.).

**Energy:** The character transforms into a being of pure energy (choose electricity, light, radiation, etc.). When in energy form the character may do such things as:

  - Jump into power lines and travel through them. (Electricity)

  - Move at the speed of light. (Light)

  - Cause radiation burns and sickness. (Radiation)

**Fire:** The character transforms into a being of pure fire. When in fire form the character is capable of setting things on fire.

**Metal:** The character transforms into a being of pure metal (player's choice as to the kind of metal). The Rank Value of the character's Brawn is changed to the Rank Value of this power or the Brawn Rank Value +10, whichever is greater.

**Water:** The character transforms into a being of pure water. When in water form the character may choose to flow like water, running through cracks and other small spaces.

### Plant Control

The character can control plants, forcing them to twist and turn and using them to wrestle, attack opponents, or block attacks. The character performs all of these actions, through a chosen plant, using the Rank Value of this power or the character's Melee +10, whichever is greater. The character can control a number of plants each turn equal to the number of times he can attack in a turn (controlling counts as an attack). The character can only control plants within a number of sectors equal to one-tenth the Rank Value of this power (round up).

### Protected Sense

One of the character's senses – either a normal sense (sight, hearing, etc.) or a supersense (see ‘Supersense') – is completely immune to damage or attacks of a Rank Value equal to or less than the Rank Value of this power. Touch, though a sense, cannot be protected.

### Reflection

The character possesses the ability to reflect the effects of another character's power back at the originating character. To use this power the character must roll d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of this power. If the result is black the reflection attempt fails and the character suffers the normal effects of the power. If the result is red both the character and the originator of the affected power suffer the normal effects of the reflected power. On any other result the power is reflected back and the originator suffers the power's full effect.

### Regeneration

The character heals quickly. Once per turn, instead of taking another action, the character may recover a number of Damage points equal to the Rank Value of this power.

### Shapeshift

The character can turn into any shape desired (animals, other characters, objects) though the character retains the character's original size (unless the character also has the Growth or Shrinking powers). The change is automatically successful unless the character attempts to impersonate a specific thing (such as another character) at which point roll d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of this power. A result of black means the character fails to adequately copy the character or object and can be easily identified.

### Sidekick

The character possesses a sidekick that assists him on adventures (and is the perfect tool when the Gamemaster wants to cause trouble). Create a second character. This new character may possess no primary trait greater than the main character's and cannot possess more than one-half the number of powers (round up) of the main character. Any results that would break these two rules are automatically reduced. The sidekick is under the Gamemaster's control.

### Superleap

The character can jump across great distances. The character may leap up to a number of sectors each turn depending on the Rank Value of the power:

|                |                  |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Sectors/Turn** |
| 01-02          | 1                |
| 03-05          | 2                |
| 06-09          | 3                |
| 10-19          | 4                |
| 20-29          | 5                |
| 30-39          | 6                |
| 40-49          | 7                |
| 50-74          | 8                |
| 75-99          | 9                |
| 100-149        | 10               |
| 150-999        | 15               |
| 1000           | \*               |

\* The character can circle the world in a single turn.

### Supersense

The character possesses a single extraordinary sense such as superhearing or supersight. Rolls made to use the heightened sense use this power's Rank Value or the character's Awareness +10, whichever is greater.

A player may, with Gamemaster approval, have an entirely new sense. For example, a character may be blind but possess echolocation ("seeing" like a bat) or infravision in addition to normal sight allowing the character to see in darkness without penalty.

### Superspeed

The character can run at superhuman speeds. The character can move up to a number of sectors per turn based on the Rank Value of this power or the character's Coordination +10, whichever is greater:

|                |                  |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Sectors/Turn** |
| 01-02          | 1                |
| 03-05          | 2                |
| 06-09          | 3                |
| 10-19          | 4                |
| 20-29          | 5                |
| 30-39          | 6                |
| 40-49          | 7                |
| 50-74          | 8                |
| 75-99          | 9                |
| 100-149        | 10               |
| 150-999        | 15               |
| 1000           | \*               |

\* The character can circle the world in a single turn.

When attempting an unusual maneuver, such as running across water or up walls, the player must roll d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of this power or the character's Coordination +10, whichever is greater. A result of black indicates failure.

### Telekinesis

The character possesses the mental ability to move objects without touching them. The upper limit of weight the character may lift with this power is the greater of the power's Rank Value or the character's Willpower Rank Value +10.

|                |            |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Weight** |
| 1-2            | 50 lb.     |
| 3-5            | 100 lbs.   |
| 6-9            | 200 lbs.   |
| 10-19          | 400 lbs.   |
| 20-29          | 800 lbs.   |
| 30-39          | 1 ton      |
| 40-49          | 10 tons    |
| 50-74          | 50 tons    |
| 75-99          | 80 tons    |
| 100-149        | 100 tons   |
| 150-999        | 200 tons   |
| 1000+          | 400 tons   |

**Ranged Attacks:** The character may also use this power to perform ranged attacks – by throwing an object or simply using telekinetic "force" – using the character's Willpower in place of Coordination. A successful attack deals damage equal to the Rank Value of this power.

### Telepathy

The character can read the minds of others and transmit mental messages. For all actions involving this power the character uses the greater of the power's Rank Value or the character's Willpower +10.

A character with this power may read the mind of any character with a Willpower Rank Value lower than the character's Rank Value in this power or the character's Willpower +10, whichever is greater.

A character with this power is automatically aware when someone attempts to read the character's mind. The character may attempt to block the other telepath; both characters roll d% and add the Rank Value of this power or the character's Willpower +10, whichever is greater.

### Teleportation

The character may teleport a number of sectors equal to the Rank Value of this power in a single turn. Teleporting requires the player to roll d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of this power. A result of black means the character arrives dazed at the destination sector and must spend the next turn recovering (the character may take no actions that turn).

If the character is unfamiliar with – or cannot see – the destination sector and teleports into a solid object – which can include the ground – the player must roll d% on the Master Table using the Rank Value of the character's Fortitude. A result of black immediately bounces the character back to the starting sector where the character is dazed and must spend 1-10 turns recovering (taking no actions during that time). Any other result immediately bounces the character back to the starting sector where the character is dazed for one turn.

### Trait Boost

Unlike Trait Increase (see below), this power is a temporary boost to any one primary trait of the character's choice (chosen at the time this power is acquired). Once each hour of game time the character can automatically boost the chosen trait's Rank Value by an amount equal to the Rank Value of this power. For a number of turns equal to one-tenth the newly boosted value (round up), the affected primary trait operates at this new value. At the end of this time the affected primary trait's Rank Value is reduced to one-half (round up) its normal value for 1d10 turns.

### Trait Increase

Not exactly a "power", the character increases the rank value of any two primary traits by +15 each. If this "power" is rolled twice the bonus to each primary trait chosen is increased to +20 each.

### Vehicle

The character possesses a unique and exceptional vehicle. The character selects an existing vehicle and then increases the Durability, Handling, and Velocity of the vehicle by one-half this power's Rank Value (round up). In addition to this increase the vehicle possesses two special systems – weapons, unusual abilities that mimic a power, or any other equipment the Gamemaster will approve – with each system at a Rank Value equal to one-half this power's Rank Value (round up).

### Wall-Crawling

The character can move normally, either by using a specialized device or innate means, across surfaces from which most people would fall (walls and ceilings, for example). Gamemasters should inflict a row step penalty when attempting to move across a slippery surface.

### Water Native

The character is from a watery civilization and may breathe underwater or on land. When swimming, the character moves a number of Sectors determined by the Rank Value of this power.

|                |                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Sectors Moved in One Turn When Swimming** |
| 01-02          | 1 sector                                    |
| 03-29          | 2 sectors                                   |
| 30+            | 3 sectors                                   |

### Weapon

The character possesses a weapon, or weapons, with a combined total damage equal to the Rank Value of this power.

*Example: A character with a Rank Value of 30 in this power could own two rifles, three pistols, or a bow, crossbow, and pistol.*

The character may possess weapons that do not appear within these rules or in existing 4C System games or supplements. Such new weapons must be approved by the Gamemaster.

# Playing the Game

## Master Table

Take a look at the 4C Basic System Master Table (back cover); it is the key to all actions in the game. To use the Master Table, find the appropriate Rank Value in the leftmost column, roll d%, and find your die result on the table by moving along the row. The number rolled will be in a black, red, blue, or yellow box which will give you the result:

|           |                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                                                           |
| Black     | Failed Attempt. Your action has failed.                                                                                              |
| Red       | Minor Success. Your action succeeded, but just barely; in most instances this will be enough.                                        |
| Blue      | Success. You have succeeded at your attempted action.                                                                                |
| Yellow    | Major Success. You have succeeded in a spectacular way. Some actions, as determined by the Gamemaster, will require a Major Success. |

### Row Steps

A Row Step represents a shift of one or more rows up or down the Master Table in the effective Rank Value for a single action. A Row Step can be a bonus or penalty. For example, a +1 Row Step moves the effective Rank Value to the next higher row (i.e. from 20-29 to 30-39) while a –2 Row Step moves the effective Rank Value two rows lower (i.e. from 20-29 to 6-9).

*Example: Jessica's character is trying to hit an opponent with a karate chop. The Gamemaster tells Jessica her character gains a +1 Row Step bonus due to favorable circumstances. Her character has a Melee Rank Value of 30-39, so for this one attack the bonus brings it to 40-49.*

### Advanced Master Table

There's an Advanced version of the table that expands the number of rows from 13 to 18. Other than the increased Rank Value groups the table is used in exactly the same way as in the Basic game.

## Altering The Dice

After a roll is made you may spend 25 points from Fortune to shift the result of a single roll one color left or right (from black to red, red to blue, blue to yellow, or vice-versa) on the Master Table. The roll you alter can be your own or someone else's (ally or enemy). You may spend additional points to further shift the color (i.e. from black to blue or red to black) with each additional shift costing a further 25 points. Multiple characters may spend Fortune to affect the same die roll.

*Example: Tony wants to reduce the result of an opponent's roll from blue to black. This costs 50 points (two Color Shifts), but Tony's character only has 37 points. Thus Tony can do no better than to shift it from blue to red (one Color Shift); the opponent still succeeds, but less so and Tony has 12 points remaining in his Fortune.*

## Combat

Combat in 4C takes place in turns, each of which covers an abstract amount of time equal to the action depicted in a single comic book panel. A character can perform any action that would fit into a standard panel including attack, dodge, or move. You may only attack once in a turn (the exception is the Fast Attack power which grants characters the ability to make multiple attacks in one turn). It is possible to move and attack in the same turn but you suffer a –1 Row Step penalty to your attack for every sector you move into unless you perform a rush. You may also move and dodge in the same turn but you suffer a –1 Row Step penalty to your dodge for every sector you move into.

During a turn the action takes place as follows:

1.  The Gamemaster secretly determines the actions of Gamemaster Characters.

2.  The players each state their actions for the turn.

3.  One player and the Gamemaster each roll d% to determine Initiative for their side; highest roll wins.

4.  The side that won Initiative acts.

5.  The side that lost Initiative now acts.

6.  Repeat until the combat is over.

### Optional Rule: Initiative Bonus

Each turn each side adds the highest Rank Value of Awareness of its members to the Initiative roll.

*Example: The highest Gamemaster Character Awareness Rank Value is 20 while the highest player character Awareness Rank Value is 50; the Gamemaster adds 20 to the Gamemaster Characters' Initiative roll while the player rolling for the player characters adds 50 to the Initiative roll.*

### Movement

4C games are played on a map divided into individual areas known as sectors. The number of sectors a character may move in a turn is determined by the Rank Value of Coordination.

|                |                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Sectors Moved in One Turn** |
| 01-02          | 1 sector                      |
| 03-29          | 2 sectors                     |
| 30+            | 3 sectors                     |

**Climbing:** The above table assumes a character moving horizontally along the ground; if the character is moving vertically (i.e. climbing a wall) use the following:

|                |                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Sectors\* Climbed in One Turn** |
| 01-29          | 1 sector                          |
| 30+            | 2 sectors                         |

\* One sector is approximately 10 feet.

Some powers grant characters special forms of movement. See the individual power descriptions for details.

### Advanced Movement Options

In addition to moving across sectors on the map (either through walking, running, or climbing), characters may also swim and characters that move for an extended of period of time may suffer the effects of exhaustion.

#### Swimming

Without a special power or device, a character moves only a single sector each turn when swimming. A character that sinks may hold his breath for a number of turns equal to his Fortitude Rank Value; after that point the character must roll d% on the Master Table using the character's Fortitude Rank Value:

|           |                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                       |
| Black     | You are dying.                                                   |
| Red       | You are winded; your Fortitude Rank Value drops by one Row Step. |
| Blue      | No effect.                                                       |
| Yellow    | No effect.                                                       |

The character must continue rolling once each turn, with a cumulative -1 Row Step penalty to his Fortitude Rank Value for each turn since he started drowning, until he reaches breathable air.

#### Exhaustion

A character can move for a number of turns equal to the Rank Value of his Fortitude before he runs the risk of suffering from exhaustion. The character must roll d% on the Master Table using the character's Fortitude Rank Value:

|           |                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Color** | **Result**                                 |
| Black     | You collapse and must rest for 3-30 turns. |
| Red       | You collapse and must rest for 2-20 turns. |
| Blue      | No effect.                                 |
| Yellow    | No effect.                                 |

The character must continue rolling once each turn – at a -10 penalty to his Fortitude Rank Value – until he rests for 10 turns.

### Melee Attacks

Hitting, kicking, stabbing, slashing, etc. are all types of melee attacks. To resolve a melee attack, determine whether or not it is a Bashing or Slashing attack.

**Bashing:** Any unarmed attack with fists or feet or an attack with a blunt weapon or object is a Bashing attack. Roll d% on the Master Table using your Melee Rank Value and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                      |
| Black     | Miss. You whiff.                                                                                |
| Red       | Hit. See ‘Damage'.                                                                              |
| Blue      | Pound. Your opponent suffers damage and may be knocked down (possibly into an adjacent sector). |
| Yellow    | Concuss. Your opponent suffers damage and may be knocked out.                                   |

**Slashing:** Any attack with a knife, sword, or other sharp object is a Slashing attack. Roll d% on the Master Table using your Melee Rank Value and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                    |
| Black     | Miss. Nothing but air.                                        |
| Red       | Hit. See ‘Damage'.                                            |
| Blue      | Concuss. Your opponent suffers damage and may be knocked out. |
| Yellow    | Dying. You've fatally wounded your opponent.                  |

### Ranged Attacks

Includes shooting a firearm and throwing a weapon or object, in short any attack across a distance is a ranged attack. Roll d% on the Master Table using your Coordination Rank Value and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                            |
| Black     | Miss. Wild shot.                                                                                      |
| Red       | Hit. See ‘Damage'.                                                                                    |
| Blue      | Nail. You've hit your target; if you did not declare you were trying for the Nail then this is a Hit. |
| Yellow    | Dying. You've fatally wounded your opponent.                                                          |

**Range:** Weapons are limited in range as follows:

|               |                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Weapon**    | **Range (In Sectors)**                                                                                                            |
| Bow           | 4                                                                                                                                 |
| Crossbow      | 4                                                                                                                                 |
| Pistol        | 4                                                                                                                                 |
| Rifle         | 8                                                                                                                                 |
| Shotgun       | 2                                                                                                                                 |
| Thrown Object | 1 sector per row on the Master Table starting with Rank Value 6-9; lower Rank Values can only throw an object in the same sector. |
| Power         | 1/10 the Rank Value of the power (round up)                                                                                       |

#### Optional Rule: Range Penalty

Count the number of sectors from the attacker to the target ignoring the attacker's sector but including the target's sector. For each sector the attacker suffers a -1 Row Step penalty to the effective Rank Value of Coordination for this attack.

### Rushing

To rush an opponent you must meet the following conditions:

  - The opponent cannot be in the same sector as you.

  - You must be able to reach the opponent in one turn.

If these two conditions are met you roll d% on the Master Table using your Fortitude Rank Value and gaining a +1 Row Step for each open sector you move into. Compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                      |
| Black     | Miss. You run right past.                                                                       |
| Red       | Hit. See ‘Damage'.                                                                              |
| Blue      | Pound. Your opponent suffers damage and may be knocked down (possibly into an adjacent sector). |
| Yellow    | Concuss. Your opponent suffers damage and may be knocked out.                                   |

### Wrestling

Grabbing, choking, holding, and similar attacks are all covered under wrestling. Roll d% on the Master Table using your Brawn Rank Value and compare the result to the following tables:

**Seizing:** Use this when you want to grab something out of an opponent's grasp.

|           |                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                               |
| Black     | Miss. You grab at air.                                   |
| Red       | Miss. Not quite.                                         |
| Blue      | Snatch. You've grabbed the target of your seize attempt. |
| Yellow    | Shatter. You've grabbed the item but broke it.           |

**Slipping:** Use this when you're being held by an opponent.

|           |                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                        |
| Black     | Fail. You're still held.                                          |
| Red       | Fail. Just for a second . . ., but no.                            |
| Blue      | Elude. You've escaped.                                            |
| Yellow    | Turnabout. You've not only escaped but can also reverse the hold. |

**Struggling:** Use this when you want to grab an opponent and restrain the character.

|           |                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                        |
| Black     | Fail. Not even close.                             |
| Red       | Fail. Just out of reach.                          |
| Blue      | Hold. You've successfully grappled your opponent. |
| Yellow    | Hold. You've successfully grappled your opponent. |

### Dodging

Roll d% on the Master Table using your Coordination Rank Value and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                          |
| Black     | Fail. Not quick enough.                                                                             |
| Red       | 3 Row Step. Anyone attacking you this turn suffers a -3 Row Step penalty to the appropriate Trait.  |
| Blue      | 6 Row Steps. Anyone attacking you this turn suffers a -6 Row Step penalty to the appropriate Trait. |
| Yellow    | 9 Row Steps. Anyone attacking you this turn suffers a -9 Row Step penalty to the appropriate Trait. |

### Attacking Multiple Targets at Once

When surrounded by multiple opponents in a single sector a character may elect to attack everyone at once. Roll to attack but on a Yellow result everyone is affected as if the result was Red. Any result less than Yellow is a complete miss. This only works with melee attacks.

### Damage

Any successful hit inflicts damage that is subtracted from your Damage total. When your Damage points are reduced to 0, you are Dying. The amount of damage an attack inflicts depends on what type of attack it is:

  - **Melee Attack:** Inflicts an amount of damage equal to the Rank Value of the attacker's Brawn if weaponless; a one-handed weapon adds +5 points and a two-handed weapon adds +10 points.

  - **Ranged Attack:** Inflicts a number of points of damage equal to the Material Value of the item thrown. The following is a small selection of possible objects.

|                 |                    |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| **Item Thrown** | **Material Value** |
| Concrete Block  | 20                 |
| Steel Beam      | 30                 |
| Compact Car     | 40                 |
| Pickup Truck    | 50                 |

If the attack was with a weapon it inflicts a number of points of damage as follows:

|            |            |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| **Weapon** | **Damage** |
| Bow        | 10         |
| Crossbow   | 10         |
| Pistol     | 10         |
| Rifle      | 15         |
| Shotgun    | 25         |

**Armor:** Reduces the amount of damage suffered in an attack by subtracting the armor's Rank Value from the amount of damage inflicted; any remaining points are then subtracted from Damage.

*Example: A character wearing armor with a Rank Value of 10 hit by a punch dealing 20 points of damage suffers only 10 points of damage to Damage.*

**Pulling Your Punch:** You can choose to mitigate the damage done by any of your attacks. Prior to attacking you state the reduced amount of damage your attack can cause and/or the level of success it can achieve. If your attack hits it does the reduced damage and if your level of success was greater than your limit, the success if reduced to your limit.

*Example: Gina does not want her pistol-wielding character to kill an opponent so she states her character is pulling her punch with the pistol (shooting in a non-vital area) limiting the attack's damage to a Nail result; if Gina's d% roll achieves a Dying result, it is reduced to Nail instead.*

### Advanced Combat

#### Block

Sometimes it's necessary to stop Brawn with Brawn. When blocking, roll d% on the Master Table using your Brawn Rank Value and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                                |
| Black     | Fail. Your block attempt has no effect.                                                                   |
| Red       | 1 Row Step. For purposes of damage, the Rank Value of the attacker's Brawn suffers a -1 Row Step penalty. |
| Blue      | 4 Row Steps. For purposes of damage, the Rank Value of the attacker's Brawn is reduced by 3 row steps.    |
| Yellow    | 7 Row Steps. For purposes of damage, the Rank Value of the attacker's Brawn is reduced by 6 row steps.    |

#### Catching

There are times when a character must catch something (a falling civilian, a thrown object, etc.) When catching, roll d% on the Master Table using your Coordination Rank Value and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Black     | Fail. You miss. If it was an object being thrown to harm you, such as a weapon, you're automatically hit.                                                                                                      |
| Red       | Fail. You've missed.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Blue      | You catch, but possibly harm, it. You must make a second d% roll on the Master Table using Coordination; any result less than Blue means what you caught suffers damage equal to the Rank Value of your Brawn. |
| Yellow    | Perfect catch. Good job\!                                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### Evade

Similar to dodging, except it applies to melee combat only, Evade is the act of weaving and bobbing to avoid an attack. Roll d% on the Master Table using your Melee Rank Value and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Black     | Fail. Not only did you fail but you moved into the exact spot your opponent was attacking; your opponent automatically hits you.                                                                                                            |
| Red       | Evade. You successfully evade the attack and are unharmed.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Blue      | Superior Evade. Not only did you successfully evade the attack but you've also maneuvered yourself into an enviable position; on the next turn you gain a +1 Row Step bonus to your Melee roll to attack the opponent that you just evaded. |
| Yellow    | Maximum Evade. As blue but your bonus is +2 Row Steps.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### Waiting

A character that wins initiative may choose to wait before acting, allowing opponent(s) to act first and then interrupting and taking an action at the best possible moment. For example, a character planning a ranged attack against an opponent may wait for that opponent to move closer (reducing the penalty associated with ranged attacks).

### Material Value of Common Substances

Sometimes the strength of an object will come into play. In such instances, use the following table as a point of reference:

|                    |                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Material Value** | **Substance**              |
| 1-2                | Paper                      |
| 3-5                | Plastic                    |
| 6-9                | Aluminum                   |
| 10-19              | Brick                      |
| 20-29              | Concrete                   |
| 30-39              | Stone                      |
| 40-49              | Iron                       |
| 50-74              | Steel                      |
| 75-99              | Diamond                    |
| 100+               | Magical or alien substance |

### Combat Results

The following is a listing of the various combat results mentioned previously.

**Concuss:** Compare the Rank Values of the attacker's Brawn to the defender's Fortitude. If the attacker's Rank Value is greater than the defender's the defender must roll d% on the Master Table using his Fortitude and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Black     | The defender is knocked unconscious for 1d10 turns. The defender loses all Fortitude points and can do nothing until regaining consciousness at which point the defender immediately recovers a number of Fortitude points equal to the Rank Value of Fortitude. |
| Red       | No effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Blue      | Same as Red.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Yellow    | Same as Red.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**Dying:** You are dying. Your Damage points drop to 0 and your Fortitude Rank Value drops by one Row Step on the Master Table at the end of each turn until it reaches Rank Value 0, at which point you are dead. Once you've reached Rank Value 01-02 you can stabilize yourself by spending 10 Fortune points each turn.

If you receive aid before you die, meaning someone spends a full turn tending to your wounds, you automatically stabilize; your Damage points remain at 0 but your Fortitude Rank Value stops dropping.

**Elude:** You've escaped from the hold and may move into any adjacent sector of your choice.

**Hold:** You're firmly holding your opponent. For every Turn you maintain the hold your opponent suffers a number of points of damage equal to your Brawn Rank Value.

**Nail:** This is a called ranged attack on a specific target. It is used for feats of marksmanship such as severing a rope with an arrow or shooting a gun out of someone's hand; it deals damage to the target like a normal hit The attacker must state the intention to try for this result before rolling the attack. If a Nail is not declared before the dice are rolled this result is treated as a Hit. The Gamemaster has the final say on the effect of a successful Nail attack result.

**Pound:** Compare the Rank Values of the attacker and defender's Brawn. If the attacker's Rank Value is greater than the defender's the defender rolls d% on the Master Table using Fortitude. Compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Black     | The defender is knocked down and into an adjacent sector of the attacker's choice. The defender must spend next turn getting up and can perform no other action. If there's an obstacle between the chosen sector and the defender's current sector; and if the attacker's Brawn is greater than the Material Value of the obstacle (see above), the defender is knocked through the obstacle. |
| Red       | The defender is knocked down in the currently occupied sector. The defender must spend next turn getting up and can perform no other action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Blue      | No effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Yellow    | No effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**Shatter:** Unfortunately you grabbed the object a little too hard and broke it. If the object could possibly injure someone or something, such as a gun, the Gamemaster should roll randomly to determine which character – or important item – in the sector or adjacent sectors was harmed.

**Snatch:** You've grabbed the object in question and wrested it from your opponent.

**Turnabout:** You've not only escaped your opponent's hold but can also place your own Hold on the opponent or move to an adjacent sector instead.

# Gamemastering

4C is a toolkit. As such, no suggestions or information on the "art" of being a Gamemaster are provided; if you need an introduction to being a Gamemaster, or just want to polish up on your skills, it is recommended you search online for help (various RPG messageboards may prove especially useful to novice Gamemasters).

## Using the Master Table

The Master Table has already been introduced in the Combat section, but the usefulness of the table extends beyond the confines of combat; the Master Table is the key to any an all actions characters perform.

When a character wants to attempt an action that will have an impact on the storyline (i.e. leap from rooftop to rooftop or notice an enemy hiding in a dark alley) the Gamemaster does two things:

1.  Decides which Primary Trait or power applies to the action. For example, Brawn for jumping or Awareness for noticing or Superspeed for running up a wall.

2.  Decides the difficulty of the action based on the following table:  
    **Black:** Easy.  
    **Red:** Average.  
    **Blue:** Difficult.  
    **Yellow:** Ridiculous.

The player then rolls d% based on the appropriate Trait or power and compares the color result to the color needed for success; if the result equals the color or a greater color the character's action succeeded. If the action fails, it is up to the Gamemaster to determine exactly what happens to the character as a result.

**Varying Circumstances:** In addition to setting the basic requirements for success, the Gamemaster can also use Row Step bonuses and penalties to reflect favorable or unfavorable conditions. The following are some suggested modifiers:

|                   |                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Circumstance**  | **Modifier**                                             |
| Hiding in shadows | \-5 Row Steps to opponents attempting to notice          |
| Jostling train    | \-2 Row Steps to balance along the top of the train cars |
| Raining           | \-2 Row Steps to trying to grab a wet ledge              |

## Character Health, Hit Points, or Vitality

Characters start the game with a number of Damage points equal to the total of their first four Primary Trait Rank Values (Melee, Coordination, Brawn, and Fortitude). Characters lose these points as they suffer damage (see Damage) throughout the course of an adventure and may die if reduced to 0 points (see Dying).

### Healing

Characters recover all damage between adventures.

### Optional Healing

For adventures that take place over a series of days, or if you're just looking for a little more depth in your games, characters heal a number of Damage points each night equal to the Rank Value of their Fortitude.

## Fluctuating Fortunes

Characters start the game with a number of Fortune points equal to the total of their last three Primary Trait Rank Values (Intellect, Awareness, and Willpower). These points may be spent to affect the outcome of events in the game. In addition, characters may gain and lose these points based on their actions.

### Gaining and Losing Fortune Points

Characters gain Fortune points for positive actions such as stopping crimes, winning fights, donating to charity, keeping appointments, rescuing someone from a fire, making time for friends, etc. The amount of points gained varies by the impact of the action as shown on the following table:

|              |                   |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| **Scale**    | **Points Gained** |
| Personal     | \+5               |
| Neighborhood | \+10              |
| City         | \+25              |
| State        | \+50              |
| National     | \+75              |
| Global       | \+100             |

### Losing Points

Characters lose Fortune points for negative actions such as committing crimes or allowing them to happen, losing fights, failing to keep appointments, failing rescue attempts, ignoring friends, etc. The amount of points lost varies by the impact of the action as shown on the following table:

|              |                 |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| **Scale**    | **Points Lost** |
| Personal     | \-5             |
| Neighborhood | \-10            |
| City         | \-25            |
| State        | \-50            |
| National     | \-75            |
| Global       | \-100           |

## Character Assets, Means, or Resources

Lifestyle measures a character's wealth and access to other resources as shown on the table:

|                |                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Level of Wealth/Lifestyle**      |
| 1-2            | Unemployment or state benefits.    |
| 3-5            | Student or part-time employment.   |
| 6-9            | Full-time, hourly wage employment. |
| 10-19          | Professional employment.           |
| 20-29          | Independently wealthy.             |
| 30-39          | Small corporation.                 |
| 40-49          | Large, international corporation.  |
| 50-74          | Small nation.                      |
| 75-99          | Large nation.                      |
| 100-149        | Superpower                         |
| 150-999        | Global resources.                  |
| 1000           | Galactic resources.                |

In general, the Gamemaster should allow characters to procure items and services appropriate to their Lifestyle Rank Value unless it would interfere with an adventure.

## Character Fame, Popularity, or Prestige

A character's Repute is used when a character is dealing with the public; the player rolls d% on the Master Table and checks the color result:

|           |                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Public Reaction**                            |
| Black     | Unfavorable ("Get out of here you freak\!")    |
| Red       | Favorable ("Thanks.")                          |
| Blue      | Very Favorable ("That was amazing\!")          |
| Yellow    | Extremely Favorable ("You are the greatest\!") |

**Actions Speak Louder Than Words:** The Gamemaster may assign Row Step bonuses and penalties to the d% to reflect the character's actions prior to interacting with the public. The following are some suggested modifiers:

|                  |                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Circumstance** | **Modifier**                                                           |
| Threatening      | \-2 Row Steps to reactions when threatening a citizen                  |
| Friendly         | \+2 Row Steps to reactions when treating citizens in a friendly manner |

**Dealing with Criminals:** The above assumes the character is dealing with law-abiding citizenry. If the character is interacting with criminals the table is reversed; a black result indicates a favorable response.

### Gaining and Losing Repute Points

Each time a character stops a crime or saves a life (or, if things aren't going well, commits a crime or kills), and the action is known to the public, the character gains or loses Repute points:

|                           |     |
| ------------------------- | --- |
| **Points Gained or Lost** |     |
| Thwart Criminal Activity  | \+1 |
| Save a Life               | \+2 |
| Commit Criminal Activity  | \-2 |

The above amounts are suggestions only. If the crime a character stopped would have affected the entire city or if the life the character saved was that of someone "important" or "famous", the character may gain bonus points.

## Vehicles

Except for those with special movement powers, characters will need to rely on vehicles if they want to quickly cross long distances.

All vehicles are defined by three Vehicle Traits:

### Durability

This Vehicle Trait is a measure of how much damage a vehicle can suffer before it is destroyed. It also doubles as armor, reducing the damage the vehicle and characters inside the vehicle suffer from an attack by its value.

This Vehicle Trait uses a numerical score (not Rank Value) that is decreased as the vehicle takes damage and increased when the vehicle is repaired; this Vehicle Trait may never drop below a score of 0 and never be raised above its starting value. Damaging and repairing vehicles is discussed below.

### Handling

This Vehicle Trait measures the agility of a vehicle. This Vehicle Trait uses a Rank Value. Performing sharp turns or other unusual maneuvers is handled with this Trait; roll d% and compare the color result to the difficulty of the maneuver on the following table:

|           |                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Difficulty**                                                             |
| Black     | Easy (standard turns)                                                      |
| Red       | Average (sharp turns)                                                      |
| Blue      | Difficult (jumping over a broken bridge)                                   |
| Yellow    | Ridiculous (turning a car on to two wheels to slip through a narrow alley) |

If the result equals the color or a greater color the maneuver succeeded. If the maneuver fails the vehicle crashes.

**Crash:** When a vehicle crashes its operator must roll for the severity of the crash. Roll d% on the Master Table using the operator's Coordination Rank Value and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Black     | Vehicle crashes into an appropriate object, character, or vehicle (as determined by the Gamemaster) in the same sector in which the maneuver was attempted. If the vehicle crashes into a character or other vehicle there is a chance for the vehicle to avoid the crash (see ‘Collision'). |
| Red       | As black but the vehicle crashes in an adjacent sector to the one in which the maneuver was attempted.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Blue      | Same as red.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Yellow    | Same as red.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

For purposes of damage inflicted/suffered, a crash is treated like a collision. If there is nothing but ground to hit in the sector the vehicle crashes into the ground (Material Value 50).

### Velocity

This Vehicle Trait measures the number of sectors a vehicle may move in a single turn. This Vehicle Trait uses a numerical score (not Rank Value).

### Vehicle Combat

Vehicles are attacked like characters; roll the attack and apply damage if the attack hits. Vehicles cannot wrestle or be wrestled.

**Collisions:** A vehicle hits something (a character, wall, another vehicle, etc.). A vehicle's operator may choose to purposefully hit an object (ram) and the selected target must roll d% on the Master Table using Coordination if on foot or the vehicle's Vehicle Trait \#2 (Control, Handling, Maneuvering, etc.) if operating a vehicle and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                               |
| Black     | Failure. The target is hit and suffers collision damage. |
| Red       | Success. The target gets out of the way.                 |
| Blue      | Same as red.                                             |
| Yellow    | Same as red.                                             |

**Collision Damage:** The struck object suffers a number of points of damage equal to the vehicle's Durability and the striking vehicle suffers a number of points of damage depending on what was hit:

  - *Character:* If the character has armor (either worn or natural), the vehicle suffers a number of points of damage equal to the armor's Rank Value.

  - *Vehicle:* The vehicle suffers a number of points of damage equal to the second vehicle's Durability.

  - *Object:* The vehicle suffers a number of points of damage equal to the Material Value of the hit object.

  - *Characters Inside a Vehicle:* Characters inside a vehicle that is involved in a collision suffer 10 points of damage for every sector the vehicle moved that turn prior to the collision.

A vehicle involved in a collision moves no further that turn.

### Vehicle Damage and Repairs

A vehicle with its Durability reduced to 0 is completely destroyed; it cannot be repaired. Vehicles are fully repaired between adventures.

### Sample Vehicles

The following is a small selection of vehicles. The Gamemaster should use these as a point of reference for vehicles of his own design.

|             |                |              |              |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| **Vehicle** | **Durability** | **Handling** | **Velocity** |
| Compact Car | 10             | 6            | 6            |
| Sports Car  | 10             | 30           | 12           |
| Private Jet | 20             | 10           | 20           |

# Character Advancement

As a superhero game, character advancement is slightly out-of-genre and not completely appropriate. For those of you that like advancement, though, characters may improve their traits and powers as follows:

**Traits:** A character may spend Fortune to improve the Rank Value of traits. Increasing a Rank Value by one costs a number of points equal to the current value.

*Example: Joseph wishes to increase his character's Melee from 30 to 31. This costs 30 points.*

**Powers:** The Rank Values of powers can be increased in the same way as the Rank Value of Traits: Increasing a Rank Value by one costs a number of points equal to the current value.

A character may also gain a completely new power – with its Rank Value determined randomly – by spending 1,000 points. This new power must have an in-game explanation (be it an accident, a new gadget, super serum, or any other means approved by the Gamemaster).

**Skills:** A character can gain a new skill at the cost of 250 points. As with new powers, there needs to be an in-game reason for this new skill (maybe the character has been attending night school).

# Weapons & Gear

## Introduction

One of the things that the 4C System rules are sorely lacking is a section on sample equipment. Sure, there are the occasional weapons and vehicles, but for the most part the rules provide gamemasters and players with zero guidance and assistance on weapons and gear.

Enter the 4C System Weapons & Gear series. In this infrequent series, published as I have the time to devote to the system, I plan on detailing a variety of different types of gear, gadgets, and devices, ranging from equipment suitable for near-future campaigns to magic items straight out of a fantasy setting.

As with the actual 4C System rules, all of the material in this PDF is released to the public domain. Use this material as you wish and, please, use this material as a guide to creating your own 4C System Weapons & Gear.

## Grenades

In the superheroic universe of most 4C System games, everyone from villains to heroes to military forces to criminals to alien invaders makes use of grenades. The following is a small  
selection of sample grenades, each designed for a specialized purpose. Gamemasters and players should use the described grenades as guidelines and inspiration for grenades of their own design.

The availability of the grenade is given in the brackets.

**Anti-Arcane (Rare):** This grenade is specially designed to disrupt magical powers and abilities. Any character with the Magic power that is in the same sector – or an adjacent sector – as the detonated grenade must roll d% on the Master Table using Rank Value 40 (the grenade's effective Nullification (Magic) Rank Value). If the result is black the grenade fails to disrupt the affected character's Magic power. If the result is red the affected character's Magic power works at half its effectiveness (round up). On any other result the Magic power is disrupted and will not work this turn.

**Frag (Uncommon):** 20 damage to all targets in the affected sector; 10 damage to all targets in adjacent sectors. Reduce the Rank Value of affected targets' Body Armor by 10.

**Incendiary (Uncommon):** This grenade explodes in a burst of fire (this grenade mimics the Elemental Generation (Fire) power at Rank Value 30, for purposes of control and absorption power use). All targets in the affected sector suffer 30 damage; targets in adjacent sectors suffer 15 damage. The Body Armor power and devices granting the power, unless designed to resist fire, do not work against this attack.

**Lightning (Rare):** This grenade explodes in a burst of electricity (this grenade mimics the Energy Generation (Electricity) power at Rank Value 30, for purposes of control and absorption power use). All targets in the affected sector suffer 30 damage; targets in adjacent sectors suffer 15 damage. The Body Armor power and devices granting the power, unless designed to resist electrical attacks, do not work against this attack.

**Paralytic (Rare):** All characters in the sector in which this grenade detonates must roll d% on the Master Table using their Fortitude Rank Value to resist. If the result is black the target is paralyzed – knocked down and unconscious – for 5 turns.

**Scream (Rare):** All targets within 6 sectors of a detonated Scream grenade must Roll d% on the Master Table using their Awareness Rank Value and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                                           |
| Black     | Incapacitated. The target is paralyzed – knocked down and unconscious – for 1d10/2(round down, minimum of 1) rounds. |
| Red       | Dazed. The target is dazed and must spend the next turns recovering (the character may take no actions those turns). |
| Blue      | Stunned. The target is stunned for the next round and suffers a -20 penalty on d% rolls.                             |
| Yellow    | Success\! The target manages to avoid the effects of the grenade.                                                    |

**Stench Gas (Rare):** All targets in the targeted sector, and adjacent sectors, must Roll d% on the Master Table using their Fortitude Rank Value and compare the result to the following table:

|           |                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                                                 |
| Black     | Incapacitated. The target is paralyzed – knocked down and unconscious – for 1d10/2 (round down, minimum of 1) rounds.      |
| Red       | Nauseous. The target is nauseous and must spend the next turns recovering (the character may take no actions those turns). |
| Blue      | Queasy. The target is queasy for the next round and suffers a -20 penalty on d% rolls.                                     |
| Yellow    | Success\! The target manages to avoid the effects of the grenade.                                                          |

### Thrown Weapon Range

The **4C System** rules state that the range of a thrown object is "1 sector per row on the Master Table starting with Rank Value 6-9; lower Rank Values can only throw an object in the same sector."

Let's make that easier for everyone who is using the basic rules; let's just look at a table. If you're using the Advanced rules, which make you an Advanced player, the ranges change slightly (since the Advanced table has more rows).

|                |                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Rank Value** | **Thrown Weapon Range** |
| 1-2            | Same Sector Only        |
| 3-5            | Same Sector Only        |
| 6-9            | 1 Sector                |
| 10-19          | 2 Sectors               |
| 10-29          | 3 Sectors               |
| 10-39          | 4 Sectors               |
| 40-49          | 5 Sectors               |
| 50-74          | 6 Sectors               |
| 75-99          | 7 Sectors               |
| 100-149        | 8 Sectors               |
| 150-999        | 9 Sectors               |
| 1000+          | 10 Sectors              |

Grenades, and other weapons specifically designed for throwing, grant a +1 Sector range modifier.

## Omphalos IX Precision-Fire Rifle

Advanced Weapon, Futuristic Device  
**Availability: Unique  
Attack Type:** Ranged  
**Manufacturer:** Wire, real name unknown  
**Designer:** Wire, real name unknown  
**First Appearance:** *Wire's Crusade \#1*  
**Current Whereabouts:** Destroyed (*Wire's Crusade \#3*)

A personal weapon of the vigilante Wire, the Omphalos IX was created in the dark future world of tomorrow. Before its destruction (at the hands of Wire himself, so that the weapon's technology would not fall into enemy hands), the Omphalos IX proved itself a capable, dangerous weapon able to knock down even the toughest of armored opponents.

### 4C System Information

*Accurate.* The Omphalos IX is equipped with an advanced scope and laser targeting designator that grants the user a +20 bonus to Coordination when attacking.

*Deadly Accuracy.* The Omphalos IX is so accurate that all Red attack results are stepped up to Blue; any result of Hit is immediately advanced to a Nail result.

*Armor Piercing.* The Omphalos IX's armor piercing rounds reduce the effectiveness of Body Armor; reduce the Rank Value of any target's Body Armor by one-half (round down).

*Limited Ammo.* The Omphalos IX is a conventional weapon and requires ammunition. The weapon's magazine holds 30 rounds; replacing a magazine requires 4 turns. Extra magazines and ammunition are difficult to locate though new ammunition can be created (in the proper weapons' shop or laboratory) by someone with the proper skill (Weaponsmithing, Science, Engineering, etc.). One hour of work yields 90 rounds.

*Range Drawback.* As a precision ranged weapon, the Omphalos IX is poorly suited to close-in fighting. When used to attack a target within 12 sectors, the user's Coordination Rank Value is reduced by one-half (round down). Additionally, any Blue or Yellow attack results are automatically reduced to a Red result.

*Range.* 20 Sectors.

*Damage.* 20

## Shrouded Relay

Communicator, Foreign Military Prototype  
**Availability:** Uncommon  
**Attack Type:** N/A  
**Manufacturer:** Widow's Weave Ltd.  
**Designer:** Rebecca Cognoscenti  
**First Appearance:** *Spider's Nest Quarterly* \#19  
**Current Whereabouts:** Unknown

The Shrouded Relay is an external communicator worn on the head. A superscience device that grants its wearer limited telepathic and psychic powers, the Shrouded Relay is especially valuable to those who find themselves going up against opponents known to possess Mind Control abilities. The device fits snugly, held in place with a micro-fiber that wraps around the wearers head and secures to a brace worn beneath the user's armor or clothing.

A fairly uncommon device, hundreds of Shrouded Relays have been manufactured and sold to the world's heroes, villains, and foreign militaries. Each Shrouded Relay must be properly tuned to work with other Relays; failure to do so prevents the user from communicating telepathically with others of his team.

### 4C System Information

*Telepathy.* An advanced science device, the Shrouded Relay enables its wearer to communicate telepathically with anyone else wearing a Shrouded Relay; the wearer gains Telepathy at Rank Value 50 but does not gain the ability to read minds. A character who possesses Telepathy who uses this device gains a +10 Rank Value bonus to his innate Telepathy.

*Trait Increase.* The wearer gains Trait Increase (Willpower) for as long as this device is worn. A character who possesses Trait Increase (Willpower) who uses this device gains a +5 Rank Value bonus to his Willpower.

*Tuned.* The device must be tuned. This requires a toolkit, the proper skill (Science, Engineering, Communications, etc.), and ten minutes for each Shrouded Relay in the set.

*Mind Shield.* The Shrouded Relay grants the wearer Mind Shield at Rank Value 30 for as long as the device is worn.

*Psychic Scars.* Each time the wearer uses the Shrouded Relay's Telepathy power the character must make a Willpower test on the Master Table; on a result of Black the character suffers permanent Willpower damage and loses 1point from his Willpower's Rank Value.

## Voltaic-Concussion Fist

Experimental Weapon, Military Prototype  
**Availability:** Rare  
**Attack Type:** Bashing  
**Manufacturer:** Breyfogle and Grant Research  
**Designer:** Classified**  
First Appearance:** *Smashing Slicer Comics* \#213  
**Current Whereabouts:** Unknown (last seen in *Major Patriot* \#76)

Built in the last days of the twentieth century, the Voltaic-Concussion Fist was originally conceived as an anti-powers weapon with enough strength to provide a talented normal with the ability to engage one-on-one with a powered villain. Built for the United States government's anti-powers agency, StopGAP, the Fist was used in a few test missions but was deemed too expensive for regular service and, eventually, the project was shelved.

Less than a dozen Voltaic-Concussion Fist prototypes were manufactured before the project was closed down. While most of the devices remain locked away in a secure government facility, at least three are known to have found their way onto the blackmarket. Where these three Fists are today is unknown.

### 4C System Information

*Energy Generation.* The Voltaic-Concussion Fist grants the wearer Energy Generation (Electrical) at Rank Value 40. If worn by a character that possesses Elemental/Energy Control of the matching elemental or energy type, the Voltaic-Concussion Fist grants a +10 Rank Value bonus to the character's innate power for as long as the device is worn.

*Amplified.* The Voltaic-Concussion Fist grants the wearer Amplified Energy Control (Electrical) at Rank Value 30 for as long as the device is worn.

*Draining.* The Voltaic-Concussion Fist is a powered device that must be attached to a specialized backpack. The backpack carries enough power for 20 uses before it must be recharged. Recharging the device requires an advanced energy supply (found in most special labs but not in your garage) and 3d10+5 turns. A power belt may be used in place of the backpack; the belt provides enough power for 10 uses and requires 2d10+5 turns to recharge. A user may wear both the belt and backpack though the Fist can only be connected to one of the two power sources at a time; switching between power sources requires 1turn.

## Potions

Single-use arcane items, potions are brewed by witches, sorcerers, and others who practice the magical arts. In a standard 4C campaign, potions are rare or unique items (gamemaster's decision) and are not commonly seen during an adventure. In low-magic superhero campaigns it is very likely that an entire adventure can be structured around a single potion (the teammates of a wounded hero, for example, must locate a magical healing potion in order to save their friend).

Drinking a potion requires 1turn and the potion's effect automatically takes place (or starts, for potions with a duration) the next turn. Characters with the Fast Attack power can sacrifice one attack each turn to drink one potion. Drinking a second potion before the first one has expired negates the granted effects of both potions.

**Dodging:** For the 3turns after drinking this potion, whenever dodging, the character replaces the dodging results table with the following:

|           |                                                                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color** | **Result**                                                                                          |
| Black     | 1 Row Step. Anyone attacking you this turn suffers a -Row Step penalty to the appropriate Trait.    |
| Red       | 4 Row Step. Anyone attacking you this turn suffers a -4 Row Step penalty to the appropriate Trait.  |
| Blue      | 8 Row Steps. Anyone attacking you this turn suffers a -8 Row Step penalty to the appropriate Trait. |
| Yellow    | Automatic. Anyone attacking you this turn automatically fails.                                      |

**Healing:** A healing potion restores 25 Damage points turn after it is administered to a wounded individual. A healing potion cannot increase a character's Damage points beyond his starting value.

**Invisibility:** Drinking an invisibility potion grants a character the Invisibility power (see the **4C System** rules) for turns.

**Strength:** Strength potions, once swallowed, increase a character's Brawn Rank Value by 2d10+10 (roll as soon as the potion is used) for 3 turns.

### More Potions

So you need a "Potion of Intellect" but there isn't one listed. No problem, you're a smart player. Just grab the "Potion of Strength," change the name and affected Primary Trait, and you're done. One "Potion of Intellect" ready for action.

You can even use this trick for potions based on powers\!

### Lesser and Greater Potions

Any potion with a set turn duration is also available in lesser and greater versions. A "lesser" potion remains in effect for 2turns while a "greater" potion remains in effect for 4 turns.

*For example, a Lesser Potion of Fortitude increases the affected character's Fortitude Trait Rank Value by 2d10+10 for 2 turns.*
